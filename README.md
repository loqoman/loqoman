Hello! My name is Darwin Clark and as of 2021 I'm pursing an undergraduate co-op degree at the University of Waterloo. I am expected to graduate in 2026 with 1.5 years of paid work experience!

While a lot of my background has been in software enginneirng, I've recently devloped a strong passion for embedded development and PCB design. In particular, I've been teaching myself C++, kicad, and bench electronics skills.
