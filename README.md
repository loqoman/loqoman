Hello! My name is Darwin Clark I'm currently pursing an undergraduate co-op degree in computer enginnering at the University of Waterloo after graduating from Bainbridge Island High School in 2021.

While a lot of my background has been in software enginneirng, I've recently devloped a strong passion for embedded development and PCB design. In particular, I have been been teaching myself C/C++, Kicad, and bench electronics skills. Over the years, I've been a part of several large Python projects and have a basic farmilarity with R.
