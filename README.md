Hello! My name is Darwin Clark I'm currently pursing an undergraduate co-op degree in computer enginnering at the University of Waterloo after graduating from Bainbridge Island High School in 2021.

While a lot of my background has been in software enginneirng, I've recently devloped a strong passion for embedded development and PCB design. In particular, I have been been teaching myself C/C++, kicad, and bench electronics skills on the side. Over the years, I've been a part of several large python projects and have a basic farmilarity with R.
