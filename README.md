**Hey there!** My name is Darwin Clark I'm currently pursing an undergraduate co-op degree in computer engineering at the University of Waterloo where I expect to graduate in early 2026.

I have over 2 years of internship experience across 7 different companies in industries such as consumer electronics, automotive, and defence. My technical focus is in systems engineering, embedded design, and PCBA design. Specifically, I have intimate knowledge of Altium, Circuit Design, and C. I hope to apply these skills in areas such as driver development, board bringup, and general-purpose embedded systems work.
