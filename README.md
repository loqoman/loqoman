**Hey there!** My name is Darwin Clark I'm currently pursing an undergraduate co-op degree in computer engineering at the University of Waterloo after graduating from Bainbridge Island High School in 2021.

While a lot of my background has been in software engineering, I've recently narrowed my focus into systems engineering, embedded programming, and PCB design. Specifically, I've been been developing my C, C++, Altium, and VHDL skills. I hope to apply these skills in areas such firmware and driver development, and general-purpose embedded systems work.

 ### *2023*
 - More to come...

 ### *2022*
 
 - Designed a theoretical high-efficiency buck converter for use on WARG competition drone ([spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IrWaX9436vcKAeru4SNB5D6RGHlH2eQq0TntfMsNFoI/edit?usp=sharing))
 - Finished a 4-month internship at Ford of Canada developing infotainment software (kotlin/java)
 - Selected IO port configuration on STM32L5 as part of the third iteration of the flight computer board (Altium)
 - Implemented FSM as part of ECE 124 (Digital Logic) final project to simulate air conditioning unit (VHDL) 
 - Developed hardware-software interface for next-generation of testing fixtures at ([Pure WaterCraft](https://www.purewatercraft.com/))
 ### *2021*
 - Designed and assembled small form-factor PCB based around 10-bit ADC as part of firmware bootcamp for WARG team members (Altium)
 - Collaborated with head roaster of Pegasus Coffee company to integrate graphical analysis with roasting process ([R](git@github.com:loqoman/pegasusInternship2021.git))
 - Assisted part-time with assembly and embedded systems prototyping for ([RipeLocker LLC](https://ripelocker.com/))
   - Later went on to design a proof-of-concept low-power BLE device to measure in-chamber respiration data ([C++/PlatformIO](https://github.com/loqoman/ripeLockerBLE))
 - Wrote a mock professional statics paper in LaTeX based investigating true randomness in microcontrollers ([PDF](https://github.com/loqoman/STATSFinalPaper/blob/main/assets/2021_H_Applied_Stats_Final_Paper.pdf))
 - Led the Innovation Challenge sub-team during the first ever virtual FIRST Robotics Competition season ([Custom Gantt Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1anXCPkiNjT96afOdMCoA267horpxSaNqKeWzhulkc9o/edit#gid=127063554&range=A1:B4))

 ### *2020*
    
 - Collected and graphically analyzed public CWOP temperature data for 2020 ASA Poster Submission ([R/GGPlot2](https://github.com/loqoman/ripeLockerBLE))
 - Developed the framework for a FRC-code compatible wireless-enabled Tetrix bot for new member training([C++/Embedded](https://github.com/loqoman/SpartronicsAutonTetrix))
 - Made first foray into PCB design with a AVR328-based 'badge' to be worn by drive team members at competition ([kicad](https://github.com/loqoman/SpartronicsBadge)) 
    
 ### *2019*
 - Under the supervision of mentor Ted Larson-Freeman, supported robotics drive team by providing live data analytics during competition ([R/Python](https://github.com/loqoman/4915DataProcessing))
 - Finished 2-year development of computer vision system for assisted motions in the driver-operated and autonomous period ([Python/OpenCV](https://github.com/spartronics4915/vision))
