**Hey there!** My name is Darwin Clark I'm currently pursing an undergraduate co-op degree in computer engineering at the University of Waterloo after graduating from Bainbridge Island High School in 2021.

While a lot of my background has been in software engineering, I've recently narrowed my focus into systems engineering, embedded development, and PCB design. In particular, I've been been teaching myself C/C++, EDA tools such as Kicad and Altium, and bench electronics skills.

 <summary><b>How to Browse my Github</b></summary>
  
  
 <em>&#13;&#10;I.E How my Github is set up and things to keep in mind when exploring </em>
  - The repositories that are 'pinned' represent my most relevent work and are the best judge of my current skill level 
  - The challenge with my Github is that it represents a professional face for my technical work but is also a personal place to sahre my hobbies. Sometimes these two goals are at odds, most of the time they arn't
  - Any repository marked `[LANG]` is being used for storage and documentation of code written as part of learning a new language or tool. Do not expect fully-documented commits or clean code. Any code checked into these repositories does not represent my current up-to-date knowledge on the subject
  - Similarly, any repository marked `[DEPRECATED]` was once a project, but is now only being saved for postarity
