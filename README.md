**Hey there!** My name is Darwin Clark I'm currently pursing an undergraduate co-op degree in computer enginnering at the University of Waterloo after graduating from Bainbridge Island High School in 2021.

While a lot of my background has been in software engineering, I've recently narrowed my focus into systems enginnering, embedded development, and PCB design. In particular, I've been been teaching myself C/C++, EDA tools such as Kicad and Altium, and bench electronics skills.
